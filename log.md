# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Janurary 5, 2018
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Installed Lubuntu on Acer Aspire One 725 and set up programming environment.

**Thoughts**: Much better preformance on Lubuntu though desktop is clunky.  VSCode is easy to set up just copy from other installation.

**Link to work:** n/a

### Day 2: Janurary 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished setting up Fish shell env on the 725 and installed Node.  Tomorrow start scaffolding out Gatsby site.

**Thoughts**: Fish shell is sick.

**Link(s) to work**: n/a
